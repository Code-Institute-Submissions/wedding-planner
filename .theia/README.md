Kasinchuk Planning



This is a website for wedding planning, it gives basic information on what the company does, which is everything. It is for couples
who dont have time to search for every apect of thier wedding and worry about missing something, there is s full team to support them.
This is a simple take and just a taste of what the company does for the dealy beloved.
All the information is on one page rather than multiple tabs making it easy to navigate for everyone. 

Features:

Feature 1 (form) - allows the user to submit thier name and email to be contacted by the company.
Feature 2 (nav-bar) - allows the user to navigate the page quickly and efficiently
Feature 3 (gallery) - allows the user to view a slide show of pictures
feature 4 (links) - allowes the user to be directed to social media pages.

Features to implement:
I would like to add a map
An online planner, that allows the user to create a plan and send it to the company
